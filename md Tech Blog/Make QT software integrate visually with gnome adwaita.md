## Make QT software integrate visually with gnome adwaita

1. First step is to install `kvantum`.

2. Then open the application "Kvantum Manager" and under "Change/Delete Theme" select `KvGnome`, `KvGnomeDark` or `kvYaru` if on ubuntu.

3. The environment variable `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum` needs to be set in order for it to work, but we can check the theme out by running an application from the console, an example with Audacious: `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum audacious`.

4. Now that we see it working, we can go ahead and add `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum` to `/etc/environment`. This can be done by opening the file with any text editor or by appending a line to the file like this: `echo 'QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum' >> /etc/environment`.

5. Qt applications should now start with the kvantum theme.

![Default Qt theme](./qt-default.png "Barrier, a Qt application with the default theming.")
![Kvantum KvGnomeDark theme](./qt-kvantum.png "The same application with the kvantum KvGnomeDark theme.")

Some applications have their own theme or settings, musescore for example doesn't follow the system theme, in krita we can go to `Settings` > `Styles` and sellect `kvantum`.
